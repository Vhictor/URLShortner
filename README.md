# URL Shortner
URL Shortner to reduce long urls
Url shortener is a service that creates a short & unique alias for links of very high size. 



We can call these shortened aliases as “short links.” These short links can then be used by users, and they are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short URLs.


Short links use lesser space, are visually aesthetic, and easier to message, tweet or printed.
